## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
Iâ€™m a junior at Cornell University studying applied engineering physics (AEP), with a focus on mechanical engineering. Outside of class I build mechatronic systems for the Cornell Rocketry Team. I have a background in semiconductor metrology at KLA and the Stanford Nanofabrication Facility.

I love ultra running, cycling, skiing, and paddleboarding.

Take a look at <a href="{{ "/projects/" | relative_url }}">my projects</a> and <a href="{{ "/cv/" | relative_url }}">CV</a>.
